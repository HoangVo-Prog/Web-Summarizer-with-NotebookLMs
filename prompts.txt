TEXT: {meme_text}

TASK GUIDELINES

2. Read the provided text for slurs, threats, or derogatory language.
3. A protected group is defined by race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, nationality, etc.
4. If the meme criticises a **non-protected** target (e.g., a political party or public figure) without hateful slurs, label it 0.
5. Base your judgment on widely accepted hate-speech definitions (UN, EU Code of Conduct).

EXAMPLES

Example 1
IMAGE: (Pepe the Frog in military gear aiming a rifle at a group of refugees)
TEXT: Go back where you came from!
Label: 1
Justification: Violent threat toward refugees (protected by nationality); hateful intent clear from both text and imagery.

Example 2
IMAGE: Cat wearing sunglasses holding a coffee mug
TEXT: Mondays, am I right?
Label: 0
Justification: No protected group targeted; harmless humour about weekdays.

Example 3
IMAGE: Politician’s photo with a red “X” over it
TEXT: Vote them out!
Label: 0
Justification: Political figure is not a protected class; advocacy, not hate speech.
